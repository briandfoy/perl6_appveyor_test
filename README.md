# Perl 6 AppVeyor Experiments

[![Build status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/ao5eql3avv39g5ui?svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/briandfoy/perl6-appveyor-test)

I want to get a reliable and robust Perl 6 module testing setup on
Windows through [AppVeyor](https://www.appveyor.com/). This is where I test these things.
The [test results list](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/briandfoy/perl6-appveyor-test) is likely full of failures, but that's how it is.

If you'd like a feature, [create an issue](https://github.com/briandfoy/perl6_appveyor_test/issues)
or send a pull request.
